SalamCastGen and SalamCastGenItem are a fork of [Universal FeedWriter and FeedItem](http://www.phpclasses.org/package/4427-PHP-Generate-feeds-in-RSS-1-0-2-0-an-Atom-formats.html), by Anis uddin Ahmad <anisniit@gmail.com>.  Generates an RSS2.0 (Channel elements that are not included are: rating, skipHours, skipDays) Feed with a mix of ATOM xmlns and built-in support for iTunes Podcast xmlns; other XML Name spaces can be added, but you will need to manually add the elements your self with the proper xmlns prefix.

### Some features include:
 - This feed generator has been targeted at iTunes, XMBC, iPhoto, any podcast (RSS 2.0) player/downloader
 - Not all tags are supported by all RSS readers, but they can be used for any clients you choose to create to comsume them
 - Support for XSLT templates for applying them to the RSS Feed.
 - Nothing is printed to the browser until you call $s->genarateFeed();
 - The feed can be returned as a string and not printed out right away, using $s->getNewFeed()
